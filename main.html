	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>There are several reasons why I want to become a software developer. Firstly, I have always been fascinated by technology and its ability to transform the world. As a developer, I would be able to contribute to this transformation by creating innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.</p>
	<p>Secondly, I love the challenge of problem-solving. Programming is all about breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and finding elegant solutions to them. This kind of mental challenge is something that really motivates me and keeps me engaged.</p>
	<p>Finally, I am drawn to the collaborative nature of software development. I enjoy working as part of a team and learning from others, and I believe that the software development community is one of the most welcoming and supportive communities out there.</p>
